# Behavior detection and control via Computer Vision
![](https://www.stemmer-imaging.se/media/uploads/products/software/CVB/CVB-Optical-Flow-App1-I0.jpg)

The idea is to control your computer by **detecting specific movements and behaviors** on your laptop webcam by associating motions to actions.<br>
This is a personal project whose goal is to fully implement and deploy a Deep Learning algorithm in a live setting.<br>
But also to compare the complexity between a Machine Learning implementation and a hand crafted one using classical image processing methods such as those from OpenCV. 

### Possible actions to implement
- Control Spotify
